# FyndSynonyms

This is a simple Chrome extension that replaces words on a website with their synonyms.

## Credits

It was originally requested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/136bicl/browser_extension_find_in_page_all_synonyms/) and is based on a code snippet written by [@marz1877](https://github.com/marz1877), which I further refactored using ChatGPT.

You can see here the entire process of using ChatGPT for developing this extension:
